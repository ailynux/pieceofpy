## Introduction

The **Raspberry Pi Pico** is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board built around the RP2040 silicon platform. This repository aims to provide you with a comprehensive guide to get started with the Pico, learn about its unique features, and explore its potential through various projects.

## Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- USB micro-B cable
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- LEDs, resistors, and other basic electronic components

### Software Setup

1. **Download and Install Thonny**:
   - Thonny is a Python IDE perfect for beginners.
   - [Download Thonny](https://thonny.org/)

2. **Install MicroPython on the Pico**:
   - Connect your Raspberry Pi Pico to your computer while holding the `BOOTSEL` button.
   - It will mount as a mass storage device named `RPI-RP2`.
   - Download the latest MicroPython `.uf2` file from the [official site](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico/).
   - Drag and drop the `.uf2` file onto the `RPI-RP2` drive.

3. **Configure Thonny**:
   - Open Thonny.
   - Go to `Tools > Options > Interpreter`.
   - Select `MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)` and the appropriate COM port.

## Hello World

Let's write our first program to blink an LED.

```python
import machine
import time

led = machine.Pin(25, machine.Pin.OUT)

while True:
    led.toggle()
    time.sleep(1)
```
- Save the script as blink.py in Thonny.
- Click the Run button to execute the script on your Pico.

  
## Unique Features
- RP2040 Microcontroller: Dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+ processor, flexible clock running up to 133 MHz.
- Low Power Consumption: Ideal for battery-powered projects.
- Rich Interface: 26 multi-function GPIO pins, including I2C, SPI, and UART.
- Programmable I/O (PIO): Custom peripheral support.
- Affordable: Cost-effective solution for various applications.
